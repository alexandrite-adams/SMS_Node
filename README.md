# SMS_Node
Goal: 
To be able to send a text through a browser. 
Ex: Sending important date/time reminders associated with your hearing time.

Important Definitions:
1.	XHR(XMLHttpRequest) â€“ a JavaScript API to create AJAX requests. Its methods provide the ability to send network requests between the browser and a server.
2.	SMS Gateway - a website that allows users to send SMS messages from a web browser to people within the cell served by that gateway. An SMS gateway can also serve as an international gateway for users with roaming capability, allowing SMS communication away from the home network
3.	API(application programming interface) - code that enables two software programs to communicate

My Recommendation:
Use Twilio by installing as Visual Studio Code extension and following the instructions in first two links. One is the step by step process to make it run, the other is a library that needs to be downloaded and added to your folder.
